+ Image versioning

+ Setp 1 : dev
  
We will use Semantic versioning because flux auto image deployer policies require it

for a given image version begins with : 1.0.0

and increases 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3 ->>>

following a minor release this would be 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 ->>>

TASK: manage the semver Rage in the Image Policy, as major and minor releases hapen 

+ Step2 : promotion to E2E
